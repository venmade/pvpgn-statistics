1) Copy/Move the pvpgn-statistics directory to a place where it can be 
accessed by the web server, rename the folder at your desire.

2) Open config.inc.php in your favorite text editor and edit the
$db_host, $db_database, $db_user, $db_pass and $db_prefix fields to reflect
your mysql settings, $homepage and $ladderroot to reflect the path to your
server and stats. You can also change other settings of your choice.

3) If you're using the old pre-1.7.9 sql layout import the STATS.sql and
d2ladder_new.sql files. If you already have tables created by pvpgn you have
to edit them manually to look like the ones in STATS.sql file. Or you
could remove them and import it.
